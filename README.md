# Contents
This repository contains all of the projects done for FSU's COP3014 Intro to Programming Class

# How to run
Download one of the project's `.cpp` file. As this was an introductory class, the files are ran from the `.cpp` file crudely. 

The compile command is
`g++ program.cpp -o program`. 

Then run it with
`./program`
